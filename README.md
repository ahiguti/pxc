PXC is a programming language used for my personal projects. It works as a translator to C++ and allows cross-compilation. PXC currently supports the following features.
* memory safety (e.g., no dangling pointer)
* compile-time checking for multi-thread safety
* metaprogramming based on untyped lambda calculus
* compile-time reflection
* macros
* dynamically typed objects
